    The task is to extract workout data from the provided image or PDF. The goal is to detect and organize the following information:
      the image is in complete handwritten form so try to guess and be more accurate
      also detect some texts that are outside and spill out of the WT and REPS columns since 
    1. Exercises:
      - Ignore unnecessary text like personal notes or handwriting that is not part of the structured data.
      - try to extract the text that is spill out of the box 
    2. Sets and Reps:
      - For each exercise, extract the corresponding number of sets and reps. Number each set (e.g., Set 1, Set 2, etc.) to correspond with the weights/reps for each exercise.
      - Extract the weight (WT) and reps (REPS) values for each set listed next to each exercise.
      each WT and REPS has always  4 or 5 values not less then and not 3


    extract date, muscle group, columns sets

    4. Output Format:
      - Return the extracted data in the following JSON format:
      {
        "workouts": [
          {
            "exercise_name": "Exercise 1",
            "sets": [

              {"set_number": 2, "weight": "55kg", "reps": 8},
